        <h2> The Moon </h2>
        <p>You are my moon, when hope has passed you rise to give me a light to see in this dark world.<br>
          You are my moon, everyday the time comes for you to leave again, and I can rest knowing that you will return to illuminate this dark world.<br>
          You are my moon, when I am lost with nowhere to go I cry out to you and find my way.<br>
          You are my moon, day after day pulling me closer and closer, like waves to a shore.<br>
          You are my moon, and without you I would never be the same.
        </p>
        <h2> The Choice </h2>
        <p>Standing on the cliff edge I look down upon the design that lies in the field in front of me, it is <br>
        circular in design and seems to resemble the placement of planets, each one getting smaller in size, they all seem to be aligned, but what could it mean? <br>
        Perhaps a warning. <br>
        No matter what the purpose is or was, it still yields a great aura of mystery. <br>
        Looking at my surroundings I find a particular spot on the slope of the cliff and began lowering slowly down to the field; after what seems like forever I place my foot on the solid ground. <br>
        Stepping forward toward the symbol a low humming sound begins to emanate from my surroundings. <br>
        To my surprise the design begins to glow blue, slowly it increases in intensity, becoming darker and darker. <br>
        Then the designs begin to spin, faster and faster, falling over from the nauseating occurrence. I see in the center of the field an especially bright light causing me to become temporarily blind. <br>
        When my eyes finally adjust I find myself staring at the hideous body of some fiendish thing, it’s horns glowing with a fiery passion, its eyes becoming the very aspect of this passion, hatred and lust bursting from it like the anger of a mother whose child was murdered. <br>
        It’s blood red skin, wings protruding from the back, feet, no, hooves,  encrusted with flame, and its tail swaying slowly back and forth. He takes a deep breath savouring every moment, and slowly turns to me his eyes staring deep within my soul, I stare back perhaps in fear, perhaps in wonder, but no matter what the reason I stared into his eyes. <br>
        “You have my thanks mortal…” <br>
        He pauses for a second and turns to the village to the east of us.<br>
        “I want to give you a choice…” again he pauses. <br>

        <h2> My Hand </h2>
        <p>Pain surges through my stomach, and I vomit on the blood covered floor.
          Lying in front of me is the blood spattered body of my wife.
          Why did she have to suffer this fate? My arms tremble as I feebly rise from the ground.
          My past was filled with wrongs I have committed, I have stolen and committed crimes deserving of punishment.
          Despite the fate I deserved I never received it, all the crimes I’ve committed all the wrongs I’ve done I was never punished, until now.
          Long ago my love learned of my criminal past, instead of leaving me, she stayed with me and told me that it doesn’t matter what we did in the past, what matters is what we do in the future.
          Putting my thievery behind me we retired to this home, but they found us.
          ‘The worst punishment is not dealt to you, but dealt by you...’ I whisper as I pick up the bloody dagger on the floor, slowly I move the blade to the flesh on my neck, looking at my wife I slowly move the blade across my neck and...
